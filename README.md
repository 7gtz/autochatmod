## Key Features

* **Real-time Chat Monitoring**: Automatically detects spam, custom flagged terms (with typo/similarity detection), and exact flagged phrases.
* **Discord Webhook Integration**: Sends instant notifications to a designated Discord channel when a message is flagged, including the message content, the sender, and an optional ping for a user or role.
* **In-Game Action Overlay (HUD)**: A clean, draggable overlay appears when you click a player's name. It provides one-click access to common moderation commands.
* **Smart Nickname Resolution**: If a player using a nickname sends a flagged message, the mod automatically resolves their real username before you take action.
* **Click-to-Act Functionality**: All player messages in chat become clickable, allowing you to quickly open the Action HUD for any user, not just flagged ones.
* **Fully Configurable**: Every feature can be toggled and tweaked in-game via the ModMenu configuration screen. Customize flagged words, whitelists, spam sensitivity, and more.
* **Audible Alerts**: A distinct sound plays whenever a message is flagged, ensuring you never miss an alert.

## Installation

This is a **client-side** mod. It only needs to be installed on the moderator's computer, not on the server.

**Prerequisites:**

You must have the following installed. All files go into your `/.minecraft/mods/` folder.

1.  **Minecraft `1.21.4`**
2.  [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
3.  [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
4.  [ModMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) (Required for in-game configuration)
5.  [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) (A dependency for the config screen)

**Steps:**

1.  Ensure all prerequisites are downloaded and placed in your `/.minecraft/mods/` folder.
2.  Download the latest `autochatmod-x.x.x.jar` file.
3.  Place the AutoChatMod JAR file into your `/.minecraft/mods/` folder.
4.  Launch Minecraft using the Fabric profile.

## Usage Workflow

Here's a typical moderation scenario using AutoChatMod:

1.  **Passive Monitoring**: Play the game as usual. The mod analyzes chat in the background.
2.  **Alert!**: A player types a message that triggers one of the detection rules.
    * **In-Game**: You will hear an alert sound, and the message will be highlighted in your chat with a prefix like `[FLAGGED]` or `[SPAM]`.
    * **On Discord**: A notification is instantly sent to your configured channel.
3.  **Take Action**:
    * In your Minecraft chat, **click the player's username** in the flagged message.
    * The **Action HUD** will appear. If the player was using a nickname, the mod automatically resolves their real name first.
4.  **Use the HUD**: With the HUD open for the target player, you can:
    * Press **`X`** to teleport to them (`/tp <username>`).
    * Press **`P`** to open your server's punishment GUI for them (`/punish <username>`).
    * Press **`C`** to close the HUD.
    * **Click and drag** the top of the HUD to move it anywhere on your screen.

### Flagged & Whitelisted Terms

* **Whitelisted Phrases**: Exact phrases that should be ignored.

### How to Get a Discord Webhook URL

1.  In your Discord server, go to `Server Settings` -> `Integrations`.
2.  Click `Webhooks` -> `New Webhook`.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The mod isn't loading!**
**A:** Make sure you have installed the correct versions of Minecraft, Fabric Loader, Fabric API, ModMenu, and Cloth Config API. All are required.

**Q: My Discord webhook isn't working.**
**A:** Double-check that you have copied the entire URL correctly into the config. Test the webhook in Discord's settings to ensure it's active. Also, ensure the mod is enabled in the config.

**Q: The mod is flagging messages I don't want it to.**
**A:** The `Similarity Threshold` might be too low, or you may need to add words to the `Whitelisted Terms` list. For example, if "grape" is being flagged because it's similar to a flagged word, add "grape" to the whitelist.
